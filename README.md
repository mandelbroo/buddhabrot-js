buddhabrot-js
=============

Minimalistic Buddhabrot generator using canvas and web workers.

##Buddhabrot

*The Buddhabrot is a map related to the Mandelbrot set. Its name reflects its similarity to classical depictions of Gautama Buddha, seated in a meditation pose with a forehead mark (tikka) and traditional topknot (ushnisha).* - Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhabrot)

##Requirements

HTML5 Canvas and Web worker compatible browser. This is a hard requirement.

- Google Chrome 13+ (Tested)
- Firefox 8+ (Untested)
- IE 10 (Untested)
- Opera 11.50+ (Untested)
- Safari 5.1+ (Tested)

The interface also uses jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap but the algorithm itself does not depend on any third-party plugins.

Also worth noting the same domain policy applied by browser when resolving the worker object. This should not cause any headache if you are running the code behind a virtual host.

##TODO

- Better optimization
- Improved sampling (pre-generated warm-ups)
- Improved "fittness" algorithm to merge different results generated by seperate workors
- Implement zooming (see Metropolis-Hastings)
- HSL Color slider
- ???
